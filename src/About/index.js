        <p>Finegrind was built using the latest web technologies by Badal Moradia and David Kolia in Chicago. Fresh from General Assembly's Web Development Intensive cohort, these two built fineGrind using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, and MongoDB. The map API is courtesy of Google Maps and Geoplugin.com. The design, icons by Font Awesome, and logos were created using Adobe Creative Cloud tools.</p>
