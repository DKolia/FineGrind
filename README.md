# Introduction


fineGrind

The fast job finding app using local maps to get things done. Find yourself a gig, from bartending, cleaning, and others to handiwork and plumbing. Register to add your own job listing, or simply browse the currently available jobs nearby to see if you can't grind a little more.


## Users


Using fineGrind, users will be able to browse and filter locally available odd jobs or "grinds". Simply click the flags you are interested in to get the user's grind listing and find out more about the opening. Register as a user yourself on our free website to offer grinds yourself.
